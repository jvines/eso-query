# eso-query
A quick script that queries the ESO raw archive for spectroscopic observations made with ESPRESSO, HARPS or FEROS.

Usage:

eso_query.py ra dec radius n output

The ra and dec are expected to be in degrees, while the radius is expected to be in arcminutes, n is the max number of rows you want to save and output is the output directory where a dat file will be saved with the results.
